Flutter Cross-Platform App with MVVM, BLoC, and ChangeNotifier
This is a Flutter app that works on macOS, Windows, iOS, and Android. It follows the MVVM architecture pattern and uses both BLoC and ChangeNotifier for state management.

Getting Started
To get started with this app, you will need to have Flutter installed on your system. You can follow the instructions in the Flutter documentation to install Flutter.

Once you have Flutter installed, you can clone this repository and run the app using the following command:
flutter run

MVVM Architecture
The MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern is a popular architecture pattern used in software development, especially for building user interfaces. It separates the responsibilities of the user interface (View) from the business logic (ViewModel) and data (Model).

In this app, the ViewModel contains the business logic, while the View displays the data to the user. The Model represents the data and is responsible for managing it.

BLoC and ChangeNotifier
Both BLoC and ChangeNotifier are state management solutions in Flutter. BLoC (Business Logic Component) is a pattern that separates the business logic from the user interface, while ChangeNotifier is a mixin that provides a way to notify listeners of changes to a class.

In this app, both BLoC and ChangeNotifier are used to manage the state of the app. BLoC is used to manage the business logic and respond to events, while ChangeNotifier is used to notify the UI of changes to the state.

Conclusion
This app demonstrates how to build a cross-platform app using Flutter, while following the MVVM architecture pattern and using both BLoC and ChangeNotifier for state management. Feel free to use this app as a template for your own projects.
